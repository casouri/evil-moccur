#+TITLE: evil-moccur

This mode intergrades [[https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/color-moccur.el][color-moccur]] with evil.

* Usage

load evil-moccur.el with either =use-package= or =(require 'evil-moccur)=.

Enable =evil-moccur-mode= with =(evil-moccur-mode)=.

With =evil-moccur-mode= enabled, 
you automatically enter =evil-moccur-state= when you starts =moccur=.

You can hit =ESC= in normal state to enter moccur state,
and hit =i= in moccur state to enter normal state.

Here is the bindings in moccur state:
